# Job-application
This is a mobile application based on react-native which allows the users to find jobs on a real map and apply for them. It is again a part of a tutorial series hosted on Udemy. The application uses wide variety of tools and components such as various navigations, MapView, Linking, push notifications, etc. For state and data management, I have used redux and redux-thunk as a middleware.
